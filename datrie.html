<h2>What is Trie?</h2>
</a>

<p><strong>Trie</strong> is a kind of digital search tree. (See
<a href="#Ref_Knuth1972">[Knuth1972]</a> for the detail of digital search tree.)
<a href="#Ref_Fredkin1960">[Fredkin1960]</a> introduced the <cite>trie</cite>
terminology, which is abbreviated from "Re<i>trie</i>val".</p>

<p><img src="trie1.gif" alt="Trie Example"></p>

<p>Trie is an efficient indexing method. It is indeed also a kind of
deterministic finite automaton (DFA) (See <a href="#Ref_Cohen">[Cohen1990]</a>,
for example, for the definition of DFA). Within the tree structure, each node
corresponds to a DFA state, each (directed) labeled edge from a parent node to
a child node corresponds to a DFA transition. The traversal starts at the root
node. Then, from head to tail, one by one character in the key string is taken
to determine the next state to go. The edge labeled with the same character is
chosen to walk. Notice that each step of such walking consumes one character
from the key and descends one step down the tree. If the key is exhausted and
a leaf node is reached, then we arrive at the exit for that key. If we get
stuck at some node, either because there is no branch labeled with the current
character we have or because the key is exhausted at an internal node, then
it simply implies that the key is not recognized by the trie.</p>

<p>Notice that the time needed to traverse from the root to the leaf is not
dependent on the size of the database, but is proportional to the length of
the key. Therefore, it is usually much faster than B-tree or any
comparison-based indexing method in general cases. Its time complexity is
comparable with hashing techniques.</p>

<p>In addition to the efficiency, trie also provides flexibility in searching
for the closest path in case that the key is misspelled. For example, by
skipping a certain character in the key while walking, we can fix the insertion
kind of typo. By walking toward all the immediate children of one node without
consuming a character from the key, we can fix the deletion typo, or even
substitution typo if we just drop the key character that has no branch to go
and descend to all the immediate children of the current node.</p>

<a name="WhatTake">
<h2>What Does It Take to Implement a Trie?</h2>
</a>

<p>In general, a DFA is represented with a <cite>transition table</cite>, in
which the rows correspond to the states, and the columns correspond to the
transition labels. The data kept in each cell is then the next state to go for
a given state when the input is equal to the label.</p>

<p>This is an efficient method for the traversal, because every transition
can be calculated by two-dimensional array indexing. However, in term of space
usage, this is rather extravagant, because, in the case of trie, most nodes
have only a few branches, leaving the majority of the table cells blanks.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a more compact scheme is to use a linked list to store the
transitions out of each state. But this results in slower access, due to
the linear search.</p>

<p>Hence, table compression techniques which still allows fast access have
been devised to solve the problem.</p>

  <li> <strong><a href="#Ref_Johnson1975">[Johnson1975]</a></strong>
       (Also explained in <a href="#Ref_Aho+1985">[Aho+1985]</a> pp. 144-146)
       represented DFA with four arrays, which can be simplified to three
       in case of trie. The transition table rows are allocated in overlapping
       manner, allowing the free cells to be used by other rows.
  <li> <strong><a href="#Ref_Aoe1989">[Aoe1989]</a></strong>
       proposed an improvement from the three-array structure by reducing
       the arrays to two.

<a name="Tripple">
<h2>Tripple-Array Trie</h2>
</a>

<p>As explained in <a href="#Ref_Aho+1985">[Aho+1985]</a> pp. 144-146, a DFA
compression could be done using four linear arrays, namely <cite>default</cite>,
<cite>base</cite>, <cite>next</cite>, and <cite>check</cite>. However, in
a case simpler than the lexical analyzer, such as the mere trie for information
retrieval, the <cite>default</cite> array could be omitted. Thus, a trie
can be implemented using three arrays according to this scheme.</p>

<h3>Structure</h3>

<p>The tripple-array structure is composed of:</p>
<ol>
  <li> <b><i>base</i></b>. Each element in <cite>base</cite> corresponds to a
       node of the trie. For a trie node <cite>s</cite>,
       <cite>base</cite>[<cite>s</cite>] is the starting
       index within the <cite>next</cite> and <cite>check</cite> pool (to be
       explained later) for the row of the node <cite>s</cite> in the
       transition table.
  <li> <b><i>next</i></b>. This array, in coordination with <cite>check</cite>,
       provides a pool for the allocation of the sparse vectors for the rows
       in the trie transition table. The vector data, that is, the vector of
       transitions from every node, would be stored in this array.
  <li> <b><i>check</i></b>. This array works in parallel to <cite>next</cite>.
       It marks the owner of every cell in <cite>next</cite>. This allows the
       cells next to one another to be allocated to different trie nodes.
       That means the sparse vectors of transitions from more than one 
       node are allowed to be overlapped.
</ol>

<div class="definition">
<p><strong>Definition 1.</strong> For a transition from state <cite>s</cite> to
<cite>t</cite> which takes character <cite>c</cite> as the input, the condition
maintained in the tripple-array trie is:</p>
<blockquote>
  <cite>check</cite>[<cite>base</cite>[<cite>s</cite>] + <cite>c</cite>]
    = <cite>s</cite><br>
  <cite>next</cite>[<cite>base</cite>[<cite>s</cite>] + <cite>c</cite>]
    = <cite>t</cite>
</blockquote>
</div>

<p><img src="tripple.gif" alt="Tripple-Array Structure"></p>

<h3>Walking</h3>

<p>According to <strong>definition 1</strong>, the walking algorithm for a
given state <cite>s</cite> and the input character <cite>c</cite> is:</p>

<div class="pseudocode">  <cite>t</cite> := <cite>base</cite>[<cite>s</cite>] + <cite>c</cite>;<br>
  <b><i>if</i></b> <cite>check</cite>[<cite>t</cite>] = <cite>s</cite> <b><i>then</i></b>
      <cite>next state</cite> := <cite>next</cite>[<cite>t</cite>]
  <b><i>else</i></b>
      <cite>fail</cite>
  <b><i>endif</i></b>
</div>

<h3>Construction</h3>

<p>To insert a transition that takes character <cite>c</cite> to traverse
from a state <cite>s</cite> to another state <cite>t</cite>, the cell
<cite>next</cite>[<cite>base</cite>[<cite>s</cite>] + <cite>c</cite>]]
must be managed to be available. If it is already vacant, we are lucky.
Otherwise, either the entire transition vector for the current owner of the
cell or that of the state <cite>s</cite> itself must be relocated. The
estimated cost for each case could determine which one to move. After finding
the free slots to place the vector, the transition vector must be
recalculated as follows. Assuming the new place begins at <cite>b</cite>,
the procedure for the relocation is:</p>

<div class="pseudocode"><b><i>Procedure</i></b> <cite>Relocate</cite>(<cite>s</cite> : <b><i>state</i></b>; <cite>b</cite> : <b><i>base_index</i></b>)
<span class="comment">{ Move base for state <cite>s</cite> to a new place beginning at <cite>b</cite> }</span>
<b><i>begin</i></b>
    <b><i>foreach</i></b> input character <cite>c</cite> for the state <cite>s</cite>
    <span class="comment">{ i.e. foreach <cite>c</cite> such that <cite>check</cite>[<cite>base</cite>[<cite>s</cite>] + <cite>c</cite>]] = <cite>s</cite> }</span>
    <b><i>begin</i></b>
        <cite>check</cite>[<cite>b</cite> + <cite>c</cite>] := <cite>s</cite>;     <span class="comment">{ mark owner }</span>
        <cite>next</cite>[<cite>b</cite> + <cite>c</cite>] := <cite>next</cite>[<cite>base</cite>[<cite>s</cite>] + <cite>c</cite>];     <span class="comment">{ copy data }</span>
        <cite>check</cite>[<cite>base</cite>[<cite>s</cite>] + <cite>c</cite>] := <b><i>none</i></b>     <span class="comment">{ free the cell }</span>
    <b><i>end</i></b>;
    <cite>base</cite>[<cite>s</cite>] := <cite>b</cite>
<b><i>end</i></b>
</div>

<a name="Double">
<h2>Double-Array Trie</h2>
</a>

<p>The tripple-array structure for implementing trie appears to be well defined,
but is still not practical to keep in a single file. The
<b><i>next/check</i></b>
pool may be able to keep in a single array of integer couples, but the
<b><i>base</i></b> array does not grow in parallel to the pool, and is therefore
usually split.</p>

<p>To solve this problem, <a href="Ref_Aoe1989">[Aoe1989]</a> reduced the
structure into two parallel arrays. In the double-array structure, the
<b><i>base</i></b> and <b><i>next</i></b> are merged, resulting in only two
parallel arrays, namely, <b><i>base</i></b> and <b><i>check</i></b>.</p>

<h3>Structure</h3>

<p>Instead of indirectly referencing through <cite>state numbers</cite> as
in tripple-array trie, nodes in double-array trie are linked directly within
the <b><i>base/check</i></b> pool.</p>

<div class="definition">
<p><strong>Definition 2.</strong> For a transition from state <cite>s</cite> to
<cite>t</cite> which takes character <cite>c</cite> as the input, the condition
maintained in the double-array trie is:</p>
<blockquote>
  <cite>check</cite>[<cite>base</cite>[<cite>s</cite>] + <cite>c</cite>]
    = <cite>s</cite><br>
  <cite>base</cite>[<cite>s</cite>] + <cite>c</cite>
    = <cite>t</cite>
</blockquote>
</div>

<p><img src="double.gif" alt="Double-Array Structure" /></p>

<h3>Walking</h3>

<p>According to <strong>definition 2</strong>, the walking algorithm for a
given state <cite>s</cite> and the input character <cite>c</cite> is:</p>

<div class="pseudocode">  <cite>t</cite> := <cite>base</cite>[<cite>s</cite>] + <cite>c</cite>;<br>
  <b><i>if</i></b> <cite>check</cite>[<cite>t</cite>] = <cite>s</cite> <b><i>then</i></b>
      <cite>next state</cite> := <cite>t</cite>
  <b><i>else</i></b>
      <cite>fail</cite>
  <b><i>endif</i></b>
</div>

<h3>Construction</h3>

<p>The construction of double-array trie is in principle the same as that of
tripple-array trie. The difference is the base relocation:</p>

<div class="pseudocode"><b><i>Procedure</i></b> <cite>Relocate</cite>(<cite>s</cite> : <b><i>state</i></b>; <cite>b</cite> : <b><i>base_index</i></b>)
<span class="comment">{ Move base for state <cite>s</cite> to a new place beginning at <cite>b</cite> }</span>
<b><i>begin</i></b>
    <b><i>foreach</i></b> input character <cite>c</cite> for the state <cite>s</cite>
    <span class="comment">{ i.e. foreach <cite>c</cite> such that <cite>check</cite>[<cite>base</cite>[<cite>s</cite>] + <cite>c</cite>]] = <cite>s</cite> }</span>
    <b><i>begin</i></b>
        <cite>check</cite>[<cite>b</cite> + <cite>c</cite>] := <cite>s</cite>;     <span class="comment">{ mark owner }</span>
        <cite>base</cite>[<cite>b</cite> + <cite>c</cite>] := <cite>base</cite>[<cite>base</cite>[<cite>s</cite>] + <cite>c</cite>];     <span class="comment">{ copy data }</span>
        <span class="comment">{ the node <cite>base</cite>[<cite>s</cite>] + <cite>c</cite> is to be moved to <cite>b</cite> + <cite>c</cite>;
          Hence, for any <cite>i</cite> for which <cite>check</cite>[<cite>i</cite>] = <cite>base</cite>[<cite>s</cite>] + <cite>c</cite>, update <cite>check</cite>[<cite>i</cite>] to <cite>b</cite> + <cite>c</cite> }</span>
        <b><i>foreach</i></b> input character <cite>d</cite> for the node <cite>base</cite>[<cite>s</cite>] + <cite>c</cite>

            <cite>check</cite>[<cite>base</cite>[<cite>base</cite>[<cite>s</cite>] + <cite>c</cite>] + <cite>d</cite>] := <cite>b</cite> + <cite>c</cite>
        <b><i>end</i></b>;
        <cite>check</cite>[<cite>base</cite>[<cite>s</cite>] + <cite>c</cite>] := <b><i>none</i></b>     <span class="comment">{ free the cell }</span>
    <b><i>end</i></b>;
    <cite>base</cite>[<cite>s</cite>] := <cite>b</cite>
<b><i>end</i></b>
</div>

<a name="Suffix">
<h2>Suffix Compression</h2>
</a>

<p><a href="Ref_Aoe1989">[Aoe1989]</a> also suggested a storage compression
strategy, by splitting non-branching suffixes into single string storages,
called <b><i>tail</i></b>, so that the rest non-branching steps are reduced
into mere string comparison.</p>

<p>With the two separate data structures, double-array branches and 
suffix-spool tail, key insertion and deletion algorithms must be modified
accordingly.</p>

<a name="Insert">
<h2>Key Insertion</h2>
</a>

<p>To insert a new key, the branching position can be found by traversing the
trie with the key one by one character until it gets stuck. The state where
there is no branch to go is the very place to insert a new edge, labeled by
the failing character. However, with the branch-tail structure, the insertion
point can be either in the branch or in the tail.</p>

<h3>1. When the branching point is in the double-array structure</h3>

<p>Suppose that the new key is a string
a<sub>1</sub>a<sub>2</sub>...a<sub>h-1</sub>a<sub>h</sub>a<sub>h+1</sub>...a<sub>n</sub>,
where
a<sub>1</sub>a<sub>2</sub>...a<sub>h-1</sub>
traverses the trie from the root to a node s<sub>r</sub> in the double-array
structure, and there is no edge labeled a<sub>h</sub> that goes out of
s<sub>r</sub>. The algorithm called <b><i>A_INSERT</i></b> in
<a href="#Ref_Aoe1989">[Aoe1989]</a> does as follows:
</p>

<div class="pseudocode">From s<sub>r</sub>, insert edge labeled a<sub>h</sub> to new node s<sub>t</sub>;
Let s<sub>t</sub> be a separate node poining to a string a<sub>h+1</sub>...a<sub>n</sub> in tail pool.
</div>

<p><img src="a_insert.gif" alt="A_INSERT algorithm" /></p>

<h3>2. When the branching point is in the tail pool</h3>

<p>Since the path through a tail string has no branch, and therefore corresponds
to exactly one key, suppose that the key corresponding to the tail is</p>

<p>
a<sub>1</sub>a<sub>2</sub>...a<sub>h-1</sub>a<sub>h</sub>...a<sub>h+k-1</sub>b<sub>1</sub>...b<sub>m</sub>,<br>
<br>
where
a<sub>1</sub>a<sub>2</sub>...a<sub>h-1</sub> is in double-array structure, and
a<sub>h</sub>...a<sub>h+k-1</sub>b<sub>1</sub>...b<sub>m</sub> is in tail.
Suppose that the substring
a<sub>1</sub>a<sub>2</sub>...a<sub>h-1</sub> traverses the trie from the root
to a node s<sub>r</sub>.
</p>

<p>And suppose that the new key is in the form</p>

<p>
a<sub>1</sub>a<sub>2</sub>...a<sub>h-1</sub>a<sub>h</sub>...a<sub>h+k-1</sub>a<sub>h+k</sub>...a<sub>n</sub>,<br>
<br>
where a<sub>h+k</sub> &lt;&gt; b<sub>1</sub>. The algorithm called
<b><i>B_INSERT</i></b> in <a href="#Ref_Aoe1989">[Aoe1989]</a> does as follows:
</p>

<div class="pseudocode">From s<sub>r</sub>, insert straight path with a<sub>h</sub>...a<sub>h+k-1</sub>, ending at a new node s<sub>t</sub>;
From s<sub>t</sub>, insert edge labeled b<sub>1</sub> to new node s<sub>u</sub>;
Let s<sub>u</sub> be separate node pointing to a string b<sub>2</sub>...b<sub>m</sub> in tail pool;
From s<sub>t</sub>, insert edge labeled a<sub>h+k</sub> to new node s<sub>v</sub>;
Let s<sub>v</sub> be separate node pointing to a string a<sub>h+k+1</sub>...a<sub>n</sub> in tail pool.
</div>

<p><img src="b_insert.gif" alt="B_INSERT algorithm" /></p>

<a name="Delete">
<h2>Key Deletion</h2>
</a>

<p>To delete a key from the trie, all we need to do is delete the tail block
occupied by the key, and all double-array nodes belonging exclusively to the 
key, without touching any node belonging to other keys.</p>

<p>Consider a trie which accepts a language K = {pool#, prepare#, preview#,
prize#, produce#, producer#, progress#} : </p>

<p><img src="trie2.gif" alt="example trie" /></p>

<p>The key "pool#" can be deleted by removing the tail string "ol#" from the
tail pool, and node 3 from the double-array structure. This is the simplest
case.</p>

<p>To remove the key "produce#", it is sufficient to delete node 14 from the
double-array structure. But the resulting trie will not obay the convention
that every node in the double-array structure, except the separate nodes which
point to tail blocks, must belong to more than one key. The path from node 10
on will belong solely to the key "producer#".</p>

<p>But there is no harm violating this rule. The only drawback is the
uncompactnesss of the trie. Traversal, insertion and deletion algoritms are
intact. Therefore, this should be relaxed, for the sake of simplicity and
efficiency of the deletion algorithm. Otherwise, there must be extra steps
to examine other keys in the same subtree ("producer#" for the deletion of
"produce#") if any node needs to be moved from the double-array structure to
tail pool.</p>

<p>Suppose further that having removed "produce#" as such (by removing only
node 14), we also need to remove "producer#" from the trie. What we have to do
is remove string "#" from tail, and remove nodes 15, 13, 12, 11, 10 (which now
belong solely to the key "producer#") from the double-array structure.</p>

<p>We can thus summarize the algorithm to delete a key
k = a<sub>1</sub>a<sub>2</sub>...a<sub>h-1</sub>a<sub>h</sub>...a<sub>n</sub>,
where a<sub>1</sub>a<sub>2</sub>...a<sub>h-1</sub> is in double-array structure,
and a<sub>h</sub>...a<sub>n</sub> is in tail pool, as follows : </p>

<div class="pseudocode">Let <cite>s<sub>r</sub></cite> := the node reached by a<sub>1</sub>a<sub>2</sub>...a<sub>h-1</sub>;
Delete a<sub>h</sub>...a<sub>n</sub> from tail;
<cite>s</cite> := <cite>s<sub>r</sub></cite>;
<b><i>repeat</i></b>
    <cite>p</cite> := parent of <cite>s</cite>;
    Delete node <cite>s</cite> from double-array structure;
    <cite>s</cite> := <cite>p</cite>
<b><i>until</i></b> <cite>s</cite> = root <b><i>or</i></b> <cite>outdegree</cite>(<cite>s</cite>) &gt; 0.
</div>

<p>Where <cite>outdegree</cite>(<cite>s</cite>) is the number of children nodes
of <cite>s</cite>.

<a name="Alloc">
<h2>Double-Array Pool Allocation</h2>
</a>

<p>When inserting a new branch for a node, it is possible that the array element
for the new branch has already been allocated to another node. In that case,
relocation is needed. The efficiency-critical part then turns out to be the
search for a new place. A brute force algoritm iterates along the
<cite>check</cite> array to find an empty cell to place the first branch, and
then assure that there are empty cells for all other branches as well.
The time used is therefore proportional to the size of the double-array pool
and the size of the alphabet.</p>

<p>Suppose that there are <cite>n</cite> nodes in the trie, and the alphabet is
of size <cite>m</cite>. The size of the double-array structure would be
<cite>n</cite> + <cite>cm</cite>, where <cite>c</cite> is a coefficient which
is dependent on the characteristic of the trie. And the time complexity of
the brute force algorithm would be
O(<cite>nm</cite> + <cite>cm<sup>2</sup></cite>).</p>

<p><a href="#Ref_Aoe1989">[Aoe1989]</a> proposed a free-space list in the
double-array structure to make the time complexity independent of the size
of the trie, but dependent on the number of the free cells only. The 
<cite>check</cite> array for the free cells are redefined to keep a pointer
to the next free cell (called G-link) : </p>

<div class="definition">
<p><strong>Definition 3.</strong> Let r<sub>1</sub>, r<sub>2</sub>, ... ,
r<sub>cm</sub> be the free cells in the double-array structure, ordered
by position. G-link is defined as follows :
<blockquote>
  <cite>check</cite>[0] = -r<sub>1</sub><br>
  <cite>check</cite>[r<sub>i</sub>] = -r<sub>i+1</sub>
    ; 1 &lt;= i &lt;= cm-1<br>
  <cite>check</cite>[r<sub>cm</sub>] = -1
</blockquote>
</div>

<p>By this definition, negative <cite>check</cite> means unoccupied in the same
sense as that for "none" <cite>check</cite> in the ordinary algorithm. This
encoding scheme forms a singly-linked list of free cells. When searching for an
empty cell, only <cite>cm</cite> free cells are visited, instead of all
<cite>n</cite> + <cite>cm</cite> cells as in the brute force algorithm.</p>

<p>This, however, can still be improved. Notice that for those cells with
negative <cite>check</cite>, the corresponding <cite>base</cite>'s are not
given any definition. Therefore, in our implementation, Aoe's G-link is
modified to be doubly-linked list by letting <cite>base</cite> of every free
cell points to a previous free cell. This can speed up the insertion and
deletion processes. And, for convenience in referencing the list head and tail,
we let the list be circular. The zeroth node is dedicated to be the entry point
of the list. And the root node of the trie will begin with cell number one.</p>

<div class="definition">
<p><strong>Definition 4.</strong> Let r<sub>1</sub>, r<sub>2</sub>, ... ,
r<sub>cm</sub> be the free cells in the double-array structure, ordered
by position. G-link is defined as follows :
<blockquote>
  <cite>check</cite>[0] = -r<sub>1</sub><br>
  <cite>check</cite>[r<sub>i</sub>] = -r<sub>i+1</sub>
    ; 1 &lt;= i &lt;= cm-1<br>
  <cite>check</cite>[r<sub>cm</sub>] = 0<br>
  <cite>base</cite>[0] = -r<sub>cm</sub><br>
  <cite>base</cite>[r<sub>1</sub>] = 0<br>
  <cite>base</cite>[r<sub>i+1</sub>] = -r<sub>i</sub>
    ; 1 &lt;= i &lt;= cm-1
</blockquote>
</div>

<p>Then, the searching for the slots for a node with input symbol set
P = {c<sub>1</sub>, c<sub>2</sub>, ..., c<sub>p</sub>} needs to iterate only
the cells with negative <cite>check</cite> : </p>

<div class="pseudocode"><span class="comment">{find least free cell s such that s &gt; c<sub>1</sub>}</span>
s := -<cite>check</cite>[0];
<b><i>while</i></b> s &lt;&gt; 0 <b><i>and</i></b> s &lt;= c<sub>1</sub> <b><i>do</i></b>
    s := -<cite>check</cite>[s]
<b><i>end</i></b>;
<b><i>if</i></b> s = 0 <b><i>then</i></b> <b><i>return</i></b> <i>FAIL</i>;  <span class="comment">{or reserve some additional space}</span>

<span class="comment">{continue searching for the row, given that s matches c<sub>1</sub>}</span>
<b><i>while</i></b> s &lt;&gt; 0 <b><i>do</i></b>
    i := 2;
    <b><i>while</i></b> i &lt;= p <b><i>and</i></b> <cite>check</cite>[s + c<sub>i</sub> - c<sub>1</sub>] &lt; 0 <b><i>do</i></b>
        i := i + 1
    <b><i>end</i></b>;
    <b><i>if</i></b> i = p + 1 <b><i>then</i></b> <b><i>return</i></b> s - c<sub>1</sub>;  <span class="comment">{all cells required are free, so return it}</span>
    s := -<cite>check</cite>[s]
<b><i>end</i></b>;
<b><i>return</i></b> <cite>FAIL</cite>;  <span class="comment">{or reserve some additional space}</span>
</div>

<p>The time complexity for free slot searching is reduced to
O(<cite>cm<sup>2</sup></cite>). The relocation stage takes 
O(<cite>m<sup>2</sup></cite>). The total time complexity is therefore
O(<cite>cm<sup>2</sup></cite> + <cite>m<sup>2</sup></cite>) = 
O(<cite>cm<sup>2</sup></cite>).</p>

<p>It is useful to keep the free list ordered by position, so that the access
through the array becomes more sequential. This would be beneficial when the
trie is stored in a disk file or virtual memory, because the disk caching or
page swapping would be used more efficiently. So, the free cell reusing
should maintain this strategy :</p>

<div class="pseudocode">t := -<cite>check</cite>[0];
<b><i>while</i></b> <cite>check</cite>[t] &lt;&gt; 0 <b><i>and</i></b> t &lt; s <b><i>do</i></b>
    t := -<cite>check</cite>[t]
<b><i>end</i></b>;
<span class="comment">{t now points to the cell after s' place}</span>
<cite>check</cite>[s] := -t;
<cite>check</cite>[-<cite>base</cite>[t]] := -s;
<cite>base</cite>[s] := <cite>base</cite>[t];
<cite>base</cite>[t] := -s;
</div>

<p>Time complexity of freeing a cell is thus O(<cite>cm</cite>).</p>

<h2>An Implementation</h2>
</a>

<p>In my implementation, I designed the API with persistent data in mind.
Tries can be saved to disk and loaded for use afterward. And in newer versions,
non-persistent usage is also possible. You can create a trie in memory, 
populate data to it, use it, and free it, without any disk I/O. Alternatively
you can load a trie from disk and save it to disk whenever you want.</p>

<p>The trie data is portable across platforms. The byte order in the disk is
always little-endian, and is read correctly on either little-endian or 
big-endian systems.</p>

<p>Trie index is 32-bit signed integer. This allows 2,147,483,646 
(2<sup>31</sup> - 2) total nodes in the trie data, which should be sufficient
for most problem domains. And each data entry can store a 32-bit integer value
associated to it. This value can be used for any purpose, up to your needs.
If you don't need to use it, just store some dummy value.</p>

<p>For sparse data compactness, the trie alphabet set should be continuous,
but that is usually not the case in general character sets.  Therefore, a map
between the input character and the low-level alphabet set for the trie is
created in the middle. You will have to define your input character set by
listing their continuous ranges of character codes in a .abm (alphabet map)
file when creating a trie. Then, each character will be automatically assigned
internal codes of continuous values.</p>
